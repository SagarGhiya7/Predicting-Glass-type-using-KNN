# Predicting-Glass-type-for-criminological-investigation-using-KNN

The goal is to predict glass type for criminological investigation using 10 features. Pre-processed and normalized the dataset to prepare it for analysis. Implemented k-nearest neighbours algorithm from scratch to classify glass type into 7 different categories. Plotted values of k along with accuracies to determine optimal k. This problem was a part of an intensive practicum exercise for Applied Machine Learning course.
